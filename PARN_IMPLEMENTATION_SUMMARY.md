# PARN Implementation Summary

## Overview

PARN (Physics-Aware Reversible Normalization) has been successfully implemented and integrated into the Token Field Network project. This implementation provides a novel approach to normalization that is specifically designed for physics-inspired deep learning models.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Core Implementation**

### 1. PARN Module (`model/wrappers.py`)
- **Decoupled Normalization**: Supports three modes (`location`, `scale`, `full`)
- **Statistics Preservation**: Automatically preserves and returns relevant statistics
- **Perfect Reversibility**: Maintains numerical precision in normalization/denormalization
- **Robust Shape Handling**: Works with both 2D and 3D tensors

### 2. PARNModel Wrapper (`model/wrappers.py`)
- **Automatic Statistics Injection**: Always injects preserved statistics as additional features
- **Explicit Augmentation**: Statistics are expanded and concatenated with normalized input
- **Output Slicing**: Automatically extracts core predictions from augmented output
- **Complete Pipeline**: Full normalization â†’ augmentation â†’ processing â†’ slicing â†’ denormalization

### 3. Training Pipeline Integration (`train.py`)
- **Strategy Detection**: Automatically detects PARN configuration in data settings
- **Dynamic Dimension Adjustment**: Calculates new input dimensions based on PARN mode
- **Model Rebuilding**: Re-builds base model with adjusted dimensions
- **Seamless Integration**: Minimal changes to existing training pipeline

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Features**

### Normalization Modes
- **Location Mode**: Removes mean, preserves scale statistics
- **Scale Mode**: Removes standard deviation, preserves location statistics  
- **Full Mode**: Removes both, preserves both statistics

### Statistics Injection
```python
# Location mode: preserves scale
x_norm = x - mean
stats = {'scale': stdev}

# Scale mode: preserves location
x_norm = x / stdev  
stats = {'location': mean}

# Full mode: preserves both
x_norm = (x - mean) / stdev
stats = {'location': mean, 'scale': stdev}
```

### Input Dimension Calculation
- **Location/Scale Mode**: `original_dim * 2`
- **Full Mode**: `original_dim * 3`

## ðŸ“Š **Testing & Validation**

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- âœ… PARN module functionality (`test/test_parn.py`)
- âœ… Training pipeline integration (`test/test_parn_integration.py`)
- âœ… Configuration loading and validation
- âœ… Mode calculations and dimension adjustments

### All Tests Passing
```bash
PYTHONPATH=/path/to/TokenFieldNetwork python test/test_parn.py
PYTHONPATH=/path/to/TokenFieldNetwork python test/test_parn_integration.py
```

## ðŸš€ **Usage Examples**

### Basic Usage
```python
from model.wrappers import PARN, create_parn_wrapper

# Create PARN module
parn = PARN(num_features=7, mode='location')
x_norm, stats = parn(x, 'norm')
x_denorm, _ = parn(x_norm, 'denorm')
```

### Model Wrapping
```python
from model.wrappers import create_parn_wrapper

# Wrap a base model with PARN
parn_model = create_parn_wrapper(base_model, num_features=7, mode='location')
output = parn_model(input_data)
```

### Training Configuration
```yaml
data:
  normalization_strategy: "parn"
  parn_mode: "location"

model:
  input_dim: 7
  embed_dim: 64
  output_dim: 7
  # ... other model parameters
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Innovations**

### 1. Decoupled Normalization
Unlike standard normalization that removes both location and scale, PARN allows fine-grained control over which physical properties are preserved.

### 2. Statistics Re-injection
The core innovation: preserved statistics are fed back to the model as additional features, providing physical context to the field evolution process.

### 3. Physics-Aware Design
Specifically designed for models with inductive biases (like TFN), making normalization synergistic with the model's physics-inspired architecture.

### 4. Reversible Framework
Maintains perfect reversibility while providing enhanced interpretability through statistics injection.

## ðŸ”„ **Integration Points**

### Model Building (`model/utils.py`)
- Automatic PARN wrapper application
- Feature dimension inference and adjustment
- Informative logging during model creation

### Training Pipeline (`train.py`)
- Strategy detection and model rebuilding
- Dynamic input dimension calculation
- Seamless integration with existing workflow

### Configuration System
- YAML-based configuration
- Backward compatibility with existing configs
- Easy switching between normalization strategies

## ðŸŽ‰ **Benefits for TFN**

1. **Physics-Informed Conditioning**: Preserved statistics provide physical context to field evolution
2. **Stable Training**: Decoupled normalization allows fine-tuning of signal properties
3. **Interpretability**: Statistics injection makes model's use of physical context explicit
4. **Flexibility**: Different modes can be tested to find optimal normalization strategy
5. **Modularity**: Unit-testable components with clear interfaces

## ðŸš€ **Ready for Production**
